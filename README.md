Nerves Examples
===============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nerves-project/nerves-examples.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nerves-project/nerves-examples)

This repository contains several Nerves example projects as sub-directories.
Most of these projects should work on all of the [Nerves supported targets](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/targets.html).
One notable exception is the `neopixel` example, which depends on the Raspberry Pi hardware and won't work on other platforms.

For detailed information on how to build an example, see the `README.md` in each application's root directory.
